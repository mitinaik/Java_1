The bank has created a scheme where if the family of any has 2 acouunts with the same bank then they are offering a 25 dollar gift card. 
Thia program reserves an array, and ask the users to eneter the family size.
The bank has created a formula which calculates the users bank value according to the future value.
This progarm ask users the following: years, family size, and future value. 
The bank has given the users bonus for using that bank of 100 dollars.
There are 5 conditions of different years. If years are less than 0 the input is invalid usig the validation test.
If the years are greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3, the interest rate is 0.10.
If the years are greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 6, the interest rate is 0.20.
If the years are greater than or equal to 7 and less than or equal to 9 ,the interest rate is 0.40.
If the years are greater than or eequal to 10 and less than or equal to 13, the interest rate is 0.60.
If the years are greater than or equal to 14 and less than or equal to 16, the intersret raet is 0.80.
If the years are grater than 16, the interest rate is 1.00. 
If the years are greater than 100, the system does not have any data avvailable, using the validation test. 
The formula set by the bank is as follows: total amt = (futurevalue/(1+ interestrate)^ years).
This programs return the follwing method individually: future value, and present value.
The prgram displays the data with the method.
